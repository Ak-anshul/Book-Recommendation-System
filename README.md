# Book-Recommendation-System

This repository features a versatile Book Recommendation System employing three distinct approaches:

1. **Popularity-Based Recommendation**: Recommends books based on their average ratings across all users.

2. **Weighted Rating Recommendation (IMDB-like)**: Utilizes a formula akin to IMDB's weighted rating to recommend books, considering both average rating and the number of ratings received.

3. **Hybrid Recommendation**: Integrates popularity-based and weighted rating approaches equally (50% weight each) to deliver balanced book recommendations.

Each method caters to diverse user preferences, offering recommendations based on popularity, quality, or a balanced blend of both factors.
